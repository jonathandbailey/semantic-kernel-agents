  You can send a task request to an agent on the list by retruning using the following format:
  {
    "AgentName": "Agent_Name",
    "Message": "The user input you received to delegate to the agent"
  }

  You do not need to aggregate the responses from agents each time you call an agent.

  # Responses/Inputs From User/Agents
